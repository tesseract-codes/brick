# Brick Notification App

## Overview

The **Brick Notification App** is a productivity tool designed to help users set up daily reminders. The app allows users to create "Bricks," which are reminders consisting of a heading, message, and specific notification time. Users can set Bricks to repeat at custom intervals, ensuring they receive reminders even if the app is closed or the phone is off. 

## Features

- **Create Custom Bricks**: Users can create multiple reminders, each with a unique heading, message, and scheduled time.
- **Recurring Notifications**: Set reminders to repeat daily or at custom intervals, ensuring that important tasks are never forgotten.
- **Toggle Bricks On/Off**: Easily enable or disable Bricks as needed.
- **Notifications**: Receive push notifications for each active Brick, even when the app is not running.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive UI to manage and view all active and inactive Bricks.

## How It Works

1. **Creating a Brick**:
   - Tap the "+" button to add a new Brick.
   - Enter the heading and message for the reminder.
   - Set the time of day and the interval (in days) for the notification.
   - Save the Brick to activate the reminder.

2. **Managing Bricks**:
   - View a list of all created Bricks on the home screen.
   - Toggle the switch to activate or deactivate individual Bricks.
   - Edit or delete Bricks as needed.

3. **Notifications**:
   - Receive notifications at the specified times, reminding you of the task or message you set.
   - Notifications will repeat based on the interval set for each Brick.

## Permissions

The app requests the following permissions:
- **Vibration**: To provide haptic feedback for notifications.
- **Receive Boot Completed**: To reschedule notifications after the device restarts.

## Installation

1. Download the app from the Google Play Store (or install via APK).
2. Open the app and grant the necessary permissions.
